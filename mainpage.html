        <p>Why do people not donate food?<br>
            The misconception of liability:
            Many grocery stores and restaurants don't give away their unused food because they are afraid of being liable if someone gets sick from their donated food.</p>

        <p>food donation ensures that a lack of reliable meals is never a barrier to education, health, and economic status. Donating food not only fuels economic progress at the macro level, but it also helps you save disposal costs and entitles tax deductions with proper receipts</p>
